## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation.
To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Logo

If you'd like to change the logo in the bottom right corner, change the `logo: "LUlogo.png"` to `logo: "LMSlogo.png"` or `logo: "CHICASlogo.png"` in the `_extensions/.../LUslides/_extension.yml` file.

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
1 + 1
```

You can also add `text marked as code`! 

# New topic! {background-color="#D9DBDB"}

To make a slide like this, use:

    # Section title {background-color="#D9DBDB"}
